# ⚙️ Computer Organization and Systems (ETU "LETI")

This repository contains research and low-level implementations focused on computer architecture and hardware-software interaction.

## 🤝 Collaboration
These projects were completed in collaboration with my teammate **Nikita Bulkin**. We practiced pair programming and joint research on processor microarchitecture.

## 🔬 Key Topics Explored
* **ISA RISC-V:** Writing assembly code for RV32I/RV32IM.
* **Memory Hierarchy:** Analyzing L1 Cache hit/miss strategies and performance.
* **Peripheral Interfacing:** Directly manipulating memory-mapped I/O for visual output.
* **Pipeline Analysis:** Debugging data hazards and control hazards in a 5-stage processor pipeline using the **Ripes** simulator.
* **Data Representation:** Endianness (Little-endian), cross-compilation from C to RISC-V.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each folder contains the **Assembly source code (.txt/.s)** and a **detailed technical report (.docx)** with execution analysis and pipeline diagrams.
